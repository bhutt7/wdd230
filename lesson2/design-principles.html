            <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>
            <h2>Raycon Global</h2>
            <div><a href="https://rayconglobal.com/">Raycon Website</a></div>

            <p>This website uses visual hierarchy very well. My favorite example is how they use bolder text in their product titles to draw the customer's attention to the primary purpose of each product. They put anything they deem most important in larger and/or bolder text than other elements.</p>

            <h1>Alignment</h1>
            <h2>Youtube</h2>
            <div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube website</a></div>
            <img src="images/youtube.jpg" alt="screenshot of Youtube webpage">

            <p>This site uses alignment in many places. All the video thumbnails are aligned to a grid, and it gives the website a very organized appearance. The elements in the sidebar and header are all aligned well too.</p>

            <h1>White Space</h1>
            <h2>IBM</h2>
            <div><a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/">IBM Website</a></div>
            <img src="images/ibm.jpg" alt="screenshot of IBM wepbage">

            <p>I believe IBM's website makes good use of white space. All the text is padded well making it easy to read, and the amount of white space between elements helps establish which elements are closely related.</p>
